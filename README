Dependencies:
- Apache Http Server (I'm using 2.2, but this shouldn't matter)
- ExtJS 4 SDK

Installation procedure:
1. Clone or download as zip
   
   git clone git@github.com:cjjavellana/cpis-reports-extjs4.git

2. Download the ExtJS 4 SDK from http://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/
	
3. Extract ExtJS 4 SDK in the same level as the cpisapp directory and rename it 
   to ext4 (if you don't, you have to change the references in the HTML files)

4. Install the Apache Http Server 

5. Copy your project folders and files into the htdocs directory of your Apache Http Server

6. Start the Apache Http Server

7. Open your favorite browser and navigate to http://localhost. You should be able to see the 
   directory listing of the htdocs directory.
